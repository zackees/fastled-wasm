# ban_std_pathbuf

A dylint that bans `std::path::PathBuf` outside an explicit per-file
allowlist (`src/allowlist.txt`). Migrated call sites should use
`fastled_cli::path::NormalizedPath` instead, which strips Windows
long-path prefixes (`\\?\`) and applies case-insensitive comparison on
case-insensitive filesystems.

## Why

Issue #114 hit a Windows-only crash where `fs::canonicalize` produced
`\\?\C:\...` paths that meson and Python's `open()` couldn't handle.
Wrapping every boundary path in `NormalizedPath` prevents that class of
regression from coming back into a different module.

## Layout

- `src/lib.rs` — the lint pass itself (ported from zccache).
- `src/allowlist.txt` — file suffixes that may still use raw `PathBuf`.

## Toolchain

Builds against `nightly-2026-03-26` (see `rust-toolchain.toml`). The main
workspace stays on stable; this sub-crate is intentionally not in the
workspace.

## Future work

Add a `cargo dylint` driver script and wire it into `bash lint` so CI
enforces the lint. For now this directory is the lint source; running it
is manual until the driver lands.
