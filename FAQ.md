### Why is this compiler so fast?

The compiler image uses compile caching. This cache is pre-warmed by compiling the Blink sketch, and then frozen. This happens for debug/release/quick builds, which is why itâ€™s so blazing fast. The whole compiler toolchain is cocked and ready to fire and then frozen in place right before it compiles your sketch.

The entire Fastled library pre-compiled as a static archive and headers made available to the sketch.

During compile time, the compiler only has to consider your code and linking against a static lib.

All of this together has eliminated 90% of the compile time. But this number will increase to 97% when I apply some of the more painful refactors to eliminate the emscripten steps (--bind) that happen at final program generation time.
