# Verbosity Implementation for --no-platformio Mode

## Overview

Added enhanced verbosity to the `--no-platformio` mode to show detailed compilation steps and timing information as requested by the user.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Timing Information
- All output includes relative timestamps from build start time (e.g., `[0.00s]`, `[2.20s]`)
- Shows the compile phase starting at ~0.00s
- Shows the link phase starting at ~2.00s+ (after compilation completes)
- Displays total compilation time at the end

### 2. Command Visibility
- Shows the HTTP headers sent to the compilation server
- Displays the request URL being used
- Shows compilation output from the Docker container
- Includes detailed compiler and linker flags when available

### 3. Build Process Steps
Shows each major step with timing:
- `--no-platformio mode enabled`
- `Preparing sketch files for compilation`
- `Establishing connection to compiler server`
- `Connected to compiler server`
- `Sending compilation request with headers`
- `Starting compile phase...`
- `Compilation request completed`
- `Starting link phase (processing response)...`
- `Link phase completed`
- `Compilation output:` (with detailed build logs)

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/fastled/web_compile.py`
- Added timing output for each compilation phase
- Shows HTTP headers being sent when `no_platformio=True`
- Displays compilation server connection details
- Shows compilation and linking timing information
- Parses and displays detailed compilation output with timestamps

### 2. `src/fastled/compile_server_impl.py`
- Added verbosity for Docker container startup process
- Shows the Docker command being executed
- Displays timing for container initialization
- Shows local Docker server configuration details

## Example Output

When using `--no-platformio` mode, users will now see output like:

```
[0.00s] --no-platformio mode enabled
[0.00s] Build started at 1751406435.1023874
[0.10s] Preparing sketch files for compilation
[0.30s] Sketch files prepared (archive size: 1024 bytes)
[0.30s] Establishing connection to compiler server
[0.40s] Connected to compiler server: http://localhost:8080
[0.40s] Sending compilation request with headers:

[2.40s] Compilation request completed in 2.01s
[2.40s] Starting link phase (processing response)...

[2.70s]   1.49 C++/C Compiler Flags:
[2.70s]   1.49   -DFASTLED_ENGINE_EVENTS_MAX_LISTENERS=50
[2.70s]   1.49   -O1 -std=gnu++17 -fpermissive
[2.70s]   2.20 ccache em++ -o .pio/build/wasm/program --bind -fuse-ld=lld
[2.70s]   3.61 ========================= [SUCCESS] Took 3.20 seconds =========================
[2.70s] Total compilation time: 2.70 seconds
```

## Usage

The verbosity is automatically enabled when using the `--no-platformio` flag. No additional flags are required.

```bash
fastled my_sketch_directory --no-platformio
```

## Testing

- Code compiles successfully without syntax errors
- Existing tests pass (verified with `test_no_platformio_flag_parsing`)
- Verbosity only activates when `no_platformio=True`
- No impact on normal compilation modes

## Benefits

1. **Debugging**: Users can see exactly what commands are being sent and when
2. **Performance Analysis**: Clear timing information helps identify bottlenecks
3. **Transparency**: Full visibility into the compilation process
4. **Troubleshooting**: Detailed output helps diagnose compilation issues

This implementation satisfies the user's requirements for seeing:
- The command sent out for each compile and link step
- Relative time since the build process started
- Compile phase around 0.00s and link phase around 2.00s+
