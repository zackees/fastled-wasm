# Repo Sync Cache Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a repo sync file cache system to prevent spurious recompilation notifications when file changes are detected but the actual content hasn't changed (e.g., due to line ending differences).

## Key Features

### 1. Content-Based Change Detection
- Loads source files into memory with normalized Unix line endings
- Compares file changes based on actual content rather than just file modification timestamps or hashes
- Prevents unnecessary recompilations when only line endings change

### 2. Targeted File Patterns
The system monitors files matching these patterns when repo syncing is active:
- `src/*.*`
- `src/platforms/wasm/**`
- `src/platforms/stub/**`
- `src/sensors/**`
- `src/fx/**`
- `src/sensor/**`
- `src/thirdparty/**`

### 3. Automatic Activation
- Automatically activates when FastLED source directory is detected (when running in a FastLED repository)
- Falls back to traditional hash-based change detection for non-tracked files

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### `RepoSyncFileCache` (`src/fastled/repo_sync_cache.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages in-memory cache of source files with normalized line endings
- **Key Methods**:
  - `load_all_files()`: Loads all matching source files into cache at startup
  - `has_file_actually_changed(file_path)`: Compares current file content with cached version
  - `is_file_tracked(file_path)`: Checks if a file is managed by the repo sync cache
  - `_normalize_line_endings(content)`: Converts all line endings to Unix format (`\n`)

#### Enhanced `FileWatcherProcess` (`src/fastled/filewatcher.py`)
- **Purpose**: Automatically detects FastLED repositories and enables repo sync filtering
- **Auto-Detection**: Checks if watching a FastLED source directory and creates repo sync cache internally
- **Transparent Operation**: Client code doesn't need to know about repo sync - it's handled automatically

### Integration Points

#### Client Server Integration (`src/fastled/client_server.py`)
When FastLED source directory is detected:
1. Creates standard `FileWatcherProcess` with the FastLED source directory
2. `FileWatcherProcess` automatically detects it's watching a FastLED repo
3. Internally creates and populates `RepoSyncFileCache` with all matching source files
4. Filters file change notifications to only include actual content changes

## Usage

### Automatic Activation
The repo sync cache automatically activates when:
1. Running the FastLED WASM compiler in a FastLED repository
2. The system detects the FastLED source directory structure
3. Source code watching is enabled

### Manual Control
The system respects existing file watching controls:
- Can be disabled via `NO_FILE_WATCHING=1` environment variable
- Integrates with existing debouncing and file exclusion patterns

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Reduces unnecessary recompilations**: Eliminates rebuilds triggered by spurious file notifications
- **Faster development cycles**: Developers don't wait for unnecessary compilations
- **Server efficiency**: Reduces load on the compilation server

### Developer Experience
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Handles line ending differences between Windows, Mac, and Linux
- **Transparent operation**: Works automatically without requiring developer configuration
- **Reliable change detection**: Only triggers recompilation when source code actually changes

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/unit/test_repo_sync_cache.py`)
- **Line ending normalization**: Verifies Windows (`\r\n`), Mac (`\r`), and Unix (`\n`) line endings are normalized
- **Spurious change detection**: Confirms line ending changes are ignored
- **Real change detection**: Ensures actual content changes are detected
- **File tracking**: Validates correct behavior for tracked vs untracked files
- **Cache loading**: Verifies all matching files are loaded correctly

### Integration Tests
- **File watcher integration**: Existing file watcher tests pass
- **Backward compatibility**: Non-repo-sync scenarios continue to work
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback when files can't be read

## Architecture Benefits

### Modular Design
- **Encapsulated logic**: Repo sync logic is hidden inside the FileWatcher
- **Clean interfaces**: Client code uses the same FileWatcher API regardless of repo sync
- **Automatic activation**: No client configuration required - activates when beneficial
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing file watching continues to work unchanged

### Extensible Framework
- **Pattern-based**: Easy to add new file patterns or directories
- **Configurable**: File patterns and behaviors can be adjusted
- **Scalable**: Efficient memory usage and file processing

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Configuration options**: Allow users to customize monitored file patterns
2. **Performance monitoring**: Add metrics for cache hit/miss rates and processing times
3. **Memory optimization**: Implement LRU cache or streaming for very large repositories
4. **Advanced filtering**: Support for more sophisticated content comparison rules

### Integration Opportunities
1. **IDE integration**: Could be extended to work with various development environments
2. **Git integration**: Could leverage Git status to optimize file monitoring
3. **Build system integration**: Could integrate with other build tools beyond FastLED

## Technical Notes

### Line Ending Normalization
The system converts all line endings to Unix format (`\n`) for consistent comparison:
- Windows `\r\n` → `\n`
- Classic Mac `\r` → `\n` 
- Unix `\n` → `\n` (unchanged)

### Memory Usage
- Files are stored in memory as normalized strings
- Memory usage scales with the size of tracked source files
- For typical FastLED repositories, memory overhead is minimal

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to hash-based detection if file reading fails
- Continues operation even if some files can't be cached
- Logs appropriate warnings for debugging

## Conclusion

The repo sync cache implementation successfully addresses the issue of spurious recompilation notifications while maintaining full backward compatibility and providing a seamless developer experience. The modular design allows for future enhancements while the comprehensive test suite ensures reliability.
